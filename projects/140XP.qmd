## Overview

My group has been working with LA crime data to answer the following research questions:

1. Can we predict whether a crime is violent or nonviolent from other variables?

2. Are certain areas more dangerous than other areas?

3. Does the time of the crime have a significant effect on if the crime is violent or not?

## Predicting Violence/Non-Violence

```{r echo=FALSE}
crime_data <- read.csv("/Users/21peterseilab/Desktop/Stats 140XP/Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present_20240221.csv")
crime_data$violent <- ifelse(is.na(crime_data$Weapon.Used.Cd), 0, 1)
populations <- data.frame("Area" = levels(factor(crime_data$AREA.NAME)), "Population" = c(175000, 40000, 220000, 182214, 171000, 200000, 300000, 225849, 167500, 150000, 250000, 200000, 200000, 164961, 150000, 165000, 8560, 325000, 228000, 196840, 251000))

crime_data$population <- rep(0, nrow(crime_data))
crime_data$population <- populations$Population[match(crime_data$AREA.NAME, populations$Area)]
base_error_rate <- mean(crime_data$violent==1)
```

One potential model we tried was a glm model using the area, it's population, and the victim's age, as predictor variables. We are still refining both our variable and model choices.

```{r warning=FALSE}
m1 <- glm(violent ~ TIME.OCC+as.factor(AREA)+Vict.Age+population, data=crime_data, family="binomial")
train_predictions <- predict(m1, data=crime_data, newdata=crime_data, type="response")
train <- rep(1, length(train_predictions))
train[train_predictions<0.5] <- 0
```

Our error rate for our predictions is:
```{r}
mean(as.factor(train)!=crime_data$violent)
```

## Comparing Different LA Areas

To compare which neighborhoods in LA were most/least dangerous, we first created some preliminary plots to explore the data.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
num_crimes <- data.frame("Area" = levels(factor(crime_data$AREA.NAME)), "Population" = c(175000, 40000, 220000, 182214, 171000, 200000, 300000, 225849, 167500, 150000, 250000, 200000, 200000, 164961, 150000, 165000, 8560, 325000, 228000, 196840, 251000))

for (i in 1:nrow(num_crimes)) {
  current_area_data <- crime_data[crime_data$AREA.NAME == num_crimes$Area[i], ]
  num_crimes[i, "TotalCrimes"] <- nrow(current_area_data)
  num_crimes[i, "ViolentCrimes"] <- sum(current_area_data$violent == 1)
  num_crimes[i, "NonViolentCrimes"] <- sum(current_area_data$violent == 0)
}

plot(num_crimes$Population, num_crimes$ViolentCrimes, main = "Number of Violent Crimes VS Population of Area", ylab = "Number of Violent Crimes", xlab = "Population", ylim = c(8000, 28500))
text(num_crimes$Population, num_crimes$ViolentCrimes, num_crimes$Area, cex=0.6, pos=3, col="blue")
```

Based on this preliminary analysis, we noticed that some areas had a disproportionate number of violent crimes compared to their populations.

To more rigorously test for signifance, we ran a chi-squared test to determine if there was a significant difference between areas. 

```{r}
chi_sqr_data <- crime_data[, c("AREA.NAME", "violent")]
chi_table <- table(crime_data$AREA.NAME, crime_data$violent)
chisq.test(chi_table)
```

As you can see, there is evidence that there is a correlation between the area and the number of violent crimes that occur, suggesting that some areas are more dangerous than others.

## Comparing Violence with the Time of the Crime

We are currently working on this part of our analysis.
